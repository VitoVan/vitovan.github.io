<h1><a name="jacks-ass" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jacks-ass"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jack's Ass</h1>
<p>2023/02</p>
<p>Jack is my friend, he had hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoid is one of the experiences which could be legitimately called: "the pain in the ass". Something grows in the ass and causes pain.</p>
<h2><a name="1" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1</h2>
<p>One day in a coffee shop, Jack and I were chattering.</p>
<p>I said: "Damn! Lisp is so cool! I wish I could have known it earlier!"</p>
<p>Then Jack said: "Is it cool enough to solve my ass problem?"</p>
<p>That was a medical problem, and I ain't no medic. Although I deeply know that Lisp is cool enough to solve it, I choose to hold my impulse and asked:</p>
<p>"What did your doctor say?"</p>
<p>"He said this is not curable by any known medicine. Once it is there, it is there. The only way to solve this problem is to cut it out. I said no."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"And I'm in pain! I can't sit for too long, otherwise, my ass will blow up."</p>
<p>"Can't you just keep standing?"</p>
<p>"That will hurt my knees! I have tried to set a bunch of timers, but they were a mess."</p>
<p>"OK, that's easy, Lisp can do it, I assure you," I said.</p>
<p>Then Jack paid for the coffee, and I sent him the software to cure his ass by the end of the day. It's just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" rel="nofollow">Pomodoro</a> timer that reminds him to stand up every 25 minutes, written in Lisp with SDL2 and Cairo Graphics.</p>
<p>I also have written a detailed manual to explain how to install the software with SBCL, SDL2, Cairo Graphics, and some other dependencies. Anyone with some basic computer knowledge could manage to install it.</p>
<h2><a name="2" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2</h2>
<p>A month later, I met Jack in the same coffee shop.</p>
<p>"How's your ass?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The hemorrhoids were gone."</p>
<p>"See? I told you, Lisp is cool!"</p>
<p>"No, I let the doctor cut my ass."</p>
<p>"Oh, Why's that?"</p>
<p>"I spent a whole day sitting in front of the computer to install SDL2, SDL_Mixer, SDL_Image, Cairo, SBCL, Quicklisp, and many other shits to get your shitty software working. Suddenly, a huge pain came from my ass. When I stood up, blood was all over the chair. Then I called the ambulance."</p>
<p>"No! Uh..."</p>
<h2><a name="3" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3</h2>
<p>That night, I couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>Jack's wounded ass is all my fault.</p>
<p>So I decided to never ask non-wizard users to install any dependencies again.</p>
<p>After uncountable days and nights sitting in front of the computer, I made it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge pain came from my ass.</p>
